# SimonGame
This is a simple Simon game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game tests your memory and concentration by playing a sequence of colors and challenging you to repeat the sequence. The game keeps track of your score and level as you progress.

 # How to Play
Open the index.html file in your browser.

You'll see a title "Press A Key to Start" on the screen.

Press any key to start the game.

The game will show you a sequence of colors by lighting them up one by one.

Your task is to click on the colors in the same sequence after the computer's turn.

If you get the sequence right, you'll move on to the next level, and the game will add one more color to the sequence.

If you make a mistake, the game will end, and you can restart by pressing any key again.
